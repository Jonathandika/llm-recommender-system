The Crystal Snowstorm (Letzenstein Chronicles, #1) : It is 1847, a time of revolutions throughout Europe. Young Catherine Ayre has been called from her quiet home in England by a grandfather she scarcely knows, Grand Duke Edmond of Letzenstein. She becomes a pawn in the political unrest of the small country. Why does her grandfather so hate her uncle Constant, the rightful heir? And just who is Rafael le Marre? Catherine is swept into exciting adventures before she can feel herself a part of the small but fascinating country of Letzenstein.\\n\\n8. De Buty & The Beast (Faerie Tale Romance) : <b>The Beast of Rose Hill</b><br /><br />The Victorian splendor of the Sedleys\\' manor was a startling incongruity next to its half-naked heiress, but Julian was not surprised; he\\'d heard rumors of Anya\\'s behavior since her shipwreck with pirates in the Caribbean. The young woman had been made a deity—a love goddess, no less!—by a tribe out there, and changed. She had returned an animal: lusty and domineering with no restraint at all. Yet if he were to tame her, he\\'d hold the key to his dreams.<br /><br /><b>&amp; De Buty</b><br /><br />Anya found herself grateful. The suitor her grandmother had provided—the next man to attempt to reform her, to break her to polite North Carolina society—lived up to his name. He <i>was</i> a beauty. But he also claimed celibacy was the way to productivity and health! The man was sick—even if he did have a good heart. Well, Anya had the cure. She would marry him, let him go about changing her...then, when Julian least expected it, she\\'d show him just how wild she really was.\\n\\n9. Heart of the Storm : <b>A bid for freedom...</b><br />The lush, misty island of Madeira seemed a perfect escape from an unwanted bridegroom for shy, bookish heiress Eliza Thoroughgood.<br /><br /><b>Ambushed by desire...</b><br />But barely have they arrived when she and her frail young cousin Aubrey find themselves captive on the exotic vessel of Cyprian Dare—a man whose bold hands and even bolder mouth arouse a tiny, wicked part of Eliza. <br /><br /><b>An exquisite revenge...</b><br />Cyprian never forgave the man who abandoned his mother and made him a bastard. Now that man\\'s heir, the boy Aubrey, will be his instrument of revenge—however furiously the beautiful Eliza guards him.<br /><br /><b>Foiled by an ecstatic love...</b><br />For Cyprian, it will be an easy matter to tame this lovely innocent in the sweet, dark seaswept night...until Eliza\\'s passionate heart challenges him to a choice he could never have foreseen.\\n\\n10. A Harlot\\'s Progress : A HARLOT\\'S PROGRESS reinvents William Hogarth\\'s famous painting of 1732 which tells the story of a whore, a Jewish merchant, a magistrate and a quack doctor bound together by sexual and financial greed. Dabydeen\\'s novel endows Hogarth\\'s characters with alternative potential lives, redeeming them for their cliched status as predators or victims. The protagonist - in Hogarth, a black slave boy, in Dabydeen, London\\'s oldest black inhabitant - is forced to tell his story to the Abolitionists in return for their charity. He refuses however to supply parade of grievances, and to give a simplistic account of beatings, sexual abuses, etc. He will not embark upon yet another fictional journey into the dark nature of slavery for the voyeuristic delight of the English reader. Instead, the old man ties the reader up in knots as deftly as a harlot her client: he spins a tale of myths, half-truths and fantasies; recreating Africa and eighteenth-century London in startlingly poetic ways. What matters to him is the odyssey into poetry, the rich texture of his narrative, not its truthfulness. In this, his fourth novel, David Dabydeen opens up history to myriad imaginary interpretations, repopulating a vanished world with a strange, defiantly vivid and compassionate humanity.'"
