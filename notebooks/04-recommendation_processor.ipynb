       "'This bracing novel introduces vivid African-American characters into the traditional territory of James Michener and Larry McMurtry, as it tells the powerful story of two black families in 1920\\'s Texas entwined in a triumphant saga of love and loss, greed, obsession, and revenge.\\n\\nThe most nostalgic and reflective of Evelyn Waugh\\'s novels, <i>Brideshead Revisited</i> looks back to the golden age before the Second World War. It tells the story of Charles Ryder\\'s infatuation with the Marchmains and the rapidly-disappearing world of privilege they inhabit. Enchanted first by Sebastian at Oxford, then by his doomed Catholic family, in particular his remote sister, Julia, Charles comes finally to recognize only his spiritual and social distance from them.\\n\\nRediscover a man Americans turned to not only for news but for humor &amp; wisdom. Growing up in Sacramento, Steffens (1866-1936) was an editor at the NY Evening Post, later at McClure’s Magazine. As popular as he was cantankerous, he brushed shoulders with presidents &amp; corporate barons, tsars &amp; dictators. His efforts to expose corruption took him all over the nation &amp; on to Mexico, Europe &amp; the new USSR, where he made his famous proclamation, ‘I have seen the future, &amp; it works!’ He would later become disenchanted with Soviet communism, &amp; eventually he returned to California, to feel again its ‘warm, colorful force of beauty’ &amp; to write what would become this best-selling memoir. Inspiring, entertaining &amp; lyrical, The Autobiography is the story of a brilliant reporter with a passion for examining the complex &amp; contradictory conditions that breed corruption, poverty &amp; misery.<br />Acknowledgments<br />A Boy on Horseback<br />Seeing New York First<br />Muckraking<br />Revolution<br />Seeing America Last<br />Illustrations<br />Index\\n\\nOn the basis of a mere handful of issues, <i>The Dolphin and The Fleuron</i> established an international reputation among professionals, scholars, and booklovers with an interest in fine bookmaking and the history of printing, illustration, and typography.

Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger describes Amma\\'s practice as a form of vernacular Islam arising in a particular locality, one in which the boundaries between Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity are fluid. In the \"healing room,\" Amma meets a diverse clientele that includes men and women, Muslim, Hindu, and Christian, of varied social backgrounds, who bring a wide range of physical, social, and psychological afflictions. Flueckiger collaborated closely with Amma and relates to her at different moments as daughter, disciple, and researcher. The result is a work of insight and compassion that challenges widely held views of religion and gender in India and reveals the creativity of a tradition often portrayed by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as singular and monolithic.'"

       "'I have some popular books that I can recommend for you:\\n\\n1. If you enjoy historical romance with a festive touch, you might like a novel where \"a wary widow is befriended by a charming duke who\\'s determined not only to win her trust, but convince her that she is the one woman for him at Christmas and for all seasons.\" A book that fits this description is \"Once Upon a Christmas Eve\" by Elizabeth Hoyt, part of her \\'Maiden Lane\\' series.\\n\\n2. For those interested in medieval literature and its connections to classical works, a book that \"seeks to define the medieval literary conventions governing allusions to certain Ovidian and Virgilian tales of love in the works of Boccaccio, Machaut, Froissart, and Chaucer\" would be a scholarly read. \"Tradition and Innovation in Chaucer\" by A. C. Spearing may offer insights into these topics.\\n\\n3. If you\\'re fascinated by the history of printing and typography, a book discussing \"<i>The Dolphin and The Fleuron</i>,\" which established an international reputation among professionals and book lovers, would be of interest. \"A History of Graphic Design\" by Philip B. Meggs provides a comprehensive look at the evolution of graphic design, including the history of printing and typography.\\n\\n4. For a classic novel that is both nostalgic and reflective, Evelyn Waugh\\'s \"<i>Brideshead Revisited</i>\" is an excellent choice. It \"looks back to the golden age before the Second World War\" and explores themes of love, loss, and the passage of time through the eyes of Charles Ryder.\\n\\n5. Lastly, for beginner readers or those looking for a phonics-based text combined with a humorous story, the \"Oxford Reading Tree\" series offers a range of books that include pictures and fold-out flaps to engage young readers and help them predict the story\\'s progression.\\n\\nRemember to check the availability of these titles as they may vary depending on your location and the edition.

Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger describes Amma\\'s practice as a form of vernacular Islam arising in a particular locality, one in which the boundaries between Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity are fluid. In the \"healing room,\" Amma meets a diverse clientele that includes men and women, Muslim, Hindu, and Christian, of varied social backgrounds, who bring a wide range of physical, social, and psychological afflictions. Flueckiger collaborated closely with Amma and relates to her at different moments as daughter, disciple, and researcher.

       "'I have some popular books that I can recommend for you:\\n\\n1. For a deep dive into medieval warfare and its impact on English and French history, you might be interested in a book that provides the \"First large-scale study of Crécy and its context, bringing out its full significance in English and French history.\" This book promises to offer a comprehensive analysis of the Battle of Crécy and its historical implications, making it a valuable read for enthusiasts of military history and medieval studies.\\n\\n2. If you\\'re fascinated by ancient civilizations and their cultural legacies, consider a book that is \"a timely work which seeks to place Egypt in its true historical context.\" This book explores the African origins of the ancient Egyptians, their advancements in arts and sciences, and their social systems. It\\'s an enlightening read that challenges conventional narratives and is recommended for those interested in Egyptology and African history.\\n\\n3. For those intrigued by the complexities of identity and its various dimensions, there\\'s a book that delves into \"the multiple interactions of race, class, and gender in feminist, lesbian, and gay studies, postcolonialism and globalization, and the interrelation of nationalism and ethnicity in ethnic and area studies.\" The collection titled \"Identities\" includes essays from leading scholars across disciplines, making it a thought-provoking read for anyone interested in cultural studies, sociology, and philosophy.\\n\\n4. If you enjoy historical fiction with rich character development, you might like a novel that \"introduces vivid African-American characters into the traditional territory of James Michener and Larry McMurtry.\" Set in 1920s Texas, this novel weaves a tale of love, loss, and the pursuit of justice, offering a unique perspective on the African-American experience during that era.\\n\\n5. Lastly, for those interested in Mesoamerican history and archaeology, there\\'s a book presenting \"an historical analysis of how Late Preclassic (300 BC to AD 250) rulers in Chiapas, Mexico, created a visual language to express political and supernatural authority.\" This work provides insights into the iconography and symbolism used by ancient rulers to assert their power, making it a fascinating read for anyone interested in pre-Columbian cultures and art history.\\n\\nEach of these books offers a window into different aspects of history and culture, and I hope you find them as enriching as they are informative.'"

No other book on South Asia has material like this.\" --Ann Grodzins Gold<br /><br />In Amma\\'s Healing Room is a compelling study of the life and thought of a female Muslim spiritual healer in Hyderabad, South India. Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger describes Amma\\'s practice as a form of vernacular Islam arising in a particular locality, one in which the boundaries between Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity are fluid. In the \"healing room,\" Amma meets a diverse clientele that includes men and women, Muslim, Hindu, and Christian, of varied social backgrounds, who bring a wide range of physical, social, and psychological afflictions. Flueckiger collaborated closely with Amma and relates to her at different moments as daughter, disciple, and researcher. The result is a work of insight and compassion that challenges widely held views of religion and gender in India and reveals the creativity of a tradition often portrayed by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as singular and monolithic.'"
