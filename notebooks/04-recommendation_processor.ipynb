It is exhaustive in its rich detail and its use of primary materials to paint the picture of a century of terror. \\n\\n3. \"Environmental Regulation: Statutory Supplement and Guide to Internet Resources, 2002 Edition\" - This excellent resource takes full advantage of online information and students\\' familiarity with it. It reflects the author\\'s dual focus on environmental regulations and the policy considerations that shape them.\\n\\n4. \"Vision & Prophecy in Amos Revised\" - This book presents the faculty lectures at the Baptist Theological Seminary in Ruschlikon in 1955. It explores Amos forty years later both in terms of its literary whole and in the context of the Book of the Twelve.\\n\\n5. \"In Amma\\'s Healing Room: Gender and Vernacular Islam in South India\" - This is a compelling study of the life and thought of a female Muslim spiritual healer in Hyderabad, South India. It describes Amma\\'s practice as a form of vernacular Islam arising in a particular locality, one in which the boundaries between Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity are fluid. \\n\\nI hope you find these books interesting and informative.'"
